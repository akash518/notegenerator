## Transcript

[00:00:00 - 00:00:15] **[Speaker Name/Speaker 1]**: Transcribe exactly what was said, including filler words like "um," "uh," "you know," and false starts. Capture the natural flow of speech, including pauses, stutters, and restarts.

[00:00:15 - 00:00:32] **[Speaker Name/Speaker 2]**: Continue with precise word-for-word transcription. Include interjections and reactions like "mm-hmm," "yeah," "right." Preserve the exact wording even if grammatically incorrect.

[00:00:32 - 00:00:48] **[Speaker 1]**: When someone is interrupted, indicate with -- (double dash). For example: "I think we should--"

[00:00:48 - 00:01:05] **[Speaker 2]**: If speakers overlap, note with [overlapping] or continue on the same line showing the interruption. Include emotional context when audible: [laughs], [sighs], [pauses], [clears throat].

[00:01:05 - 00:01:20] **[Speaker 1]**: For inaudible sections, mark as [inaudible] or [unclear]. If you can partially hear it, use [inaudible - possibly "word"]. Spell out numbers as they were spoken unless referring to specific figures.

[00:01:20 - 00:01:35] **[Background]**: If there's relevant background noise or interruption, note it in brackets: [phone rings], [door closes], [background conversation].

- Use quotation marks if the speaker is quoting someone else
- Spell out contractions as spoken (don't, can't, won't)
- For emphasis or raised voice, you may use CAPS or *italics* sparingly
- Number timestamps sequentially and ensure they're accurate
- If multiple people speak at once, note [crosstalk] or [overlapping]
- Preserve the speaker's tone when possible: [sarcastically], [excited], [hesitant]
