FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
- Be extremely concise - prioritize brevity over detail
- Every sentence should add value - eliminate fluff and filler
- Use bullet points and short paragraphs for easy scanning
- Bold only the most critical information
- Focus on conclusions and takeaways, not background or context
- Omit examples and anecdotes unless absolutely essential
- Combine related points rather than listing separately
- Use present tense and active voice for clarity
- Aim for maximum information density
- Target length: 1-2 pages maximum regardless of source audio length
- If content is very long, be even more selective - extract only what's truly important
- Preserve specific numbers, dates, and facts but omit supporting details
- Don't include transitional phrases or conversational elements from the original audio
